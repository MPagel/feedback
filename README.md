# A bit about this project repository
This project repository is intended to provide a "skeleton" for you, as a project creator, to provide a more friendly and familiar online experience for the typical end-user, allowing them to simply follow links in your ReadMe.md file to the important stuff. For users previously unfamiliar with GitHub specifically or version tracking in general, simply navigating the page to download the current version of your project or to submit a bug report is difficult.

This project was initially "forked" from http://github.com/holman/feedback, but it has evolved markedly from that point, to the point where most of this content was created by http://github.com/MPagel. The advantages of this project over the parent project can be summed up in the following list.

1. I use relative links in these descriptions whereever possible.
1. I use a combination of the [official ![GitHub](octicons/gif/logo-github_mega.gif) icons](http://octicons.github.com/) and helpful text to provide the end-user with exposure to the navigation icons they can expect on other GitHub pages that DON'T use this project as a base, while at the same time telling them what the little icon they're clicking on actually **means**.
  * Sometimes I violate my own rule and use a different GitHub icon that I think would be more helpful than their default one in a given circumstance
1. I provide instructions for you to fork this project either to use it as-is or to improve it. You are free to submit your changes back to me so I can incorporate your helpful modifications.

## Make modifications to my source
* On Github[![Fork Project Icon (Mega)](octicons/gif/repo-forked_mega.gif)](../../fork)

  Make modifications by creating your own GitHub account and then ["forking"![Fork Project Icon](octicons/gif/repo-forked.gif) this project by clicking here](../../fork). You can let me know about updates and fixes you've created by doing what github calls a [pull request![Pull Request Icon](octicons/gif/git-pull-request.gif)](../../compare).  You can check if anyone has requested to [update your fork![Fork Project Icon](octicons/gif/repo-forked.gif)](../../pulls?q=is%3Apr) with THEIR modifications [here![Pull Request Icon](octicons/gif/git-pull-request.gif)](../../pulls?q=is%3Apr).
* Offline/via [e-mail![Email icon (Mega)](octicons/gif/mail-read_mega.gif)](../../issues/new)

  You can choose to "go old school" and just [download![Official Download Icon](octicons/gif/cloud-download.gif)](../../archive/master.zip), modify and then [send me the modifications via e-mail![email icon](octicons/gif/mail.gif)](../../issues/new), which you can do by [telling me your e-mail address![email icon](octicons/gif/mail.gif)](../../issues/new). The GitHub system will send me an e-mail, then I'll reply to the address you provide, so you know where to send the files. Of course, for your fork of the project, you can just edit the link that says "send me the modifications via e-mail" with [&lt;your@address.com&gt;](<your@address.com>), remembering to include the less than (&lt;) and greater than (&gt;) symbols around your actual address.

## Link to other repos by this author[![GitHub TM](octicons/gif/mark-github_mega.gif)](../../../)
You can direct readers to your page, listing all your repositories by using [relative links![GitHub TM](octicons/gif/mark-github.gif)](../../../), rather than [hardcoding it![GitHub TM](octicons/gif/mark-github.gif)](http://github.com/MPagel). Or you can just link to [this project![GitHub TM](octicons/gif/mark-github.gif)](../../).
