### Ask a question or report a bug

Please [create a new issue](../../issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read any closed bugs

Check out the [Closed Issues](../../issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### See all feedback
Open or closed, bug or kind words, you can find it [here](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue)

### This "project" is just a skeleton
This project was forked from http://github.com/holman/feedback, but that page had the pesky little problem of using absolute, rather than relative links.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, rather than this project specifically, [ask GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact).
