## A bit about this project repository
This project repository is intended to provide a "skeleton" for you, as a project creator, to provide a more friendly and familiar online experience for the typical end-user, allowing them to simply follow links in your ReadMe.md file to the important stuff. For users previously unfamiliar with GitHub specifically or version tracking in general, simply navigating the page to download the current version of your project or to submit a bug report is difficult.

This project was initially "forked"[![Fork Project Icon](octicons/gif/repo-forked.gif)](../../fork) from http://github.com/holman/feedback, but it has evolved markedly from that point, to the point where most of this content was created by http://github.com/MPagel. The advantages of this project over the parent project can be summed up in the following list.

**After** you fork[![Fork Project Icon](octicons/gif/repo-forked.gif)](../../fork) this project, you'll have to go to your settings dialogue[![Settings Icon](octicons/gif/tools.gif)](../../settings) and enable issue tracking by checking![Check Icon](octicons/gif/check.gif) the box:white_small_square: next to "Issues" under "Features"

1. I use relative links in these descriptions whereever possible.
1. I use a combination of the [official ![GitHub](octicons/gif/logo-github_mega.gif) icons](http://octicons.github.com/) and helpful text to provide the end-user with exposure to the navigation icons they can expect on other GitHub pages that **don't** use this project as a base, while at the same time telling them what the little icon they're clicking on actually **means**.
  * Sometimes I violate my own rule and use a different GitHub icon that I think would be more helpful than their default one in a given circumstance.
1. I provide instructions for you to fork this project either to use it as-is or to improve it. You are free to submit your changes back to me so I can incorporate your helpful modifications.

Feel free to delete this top section of this file in your own fork[![Fork Project Icon](octicons/gif/repo-forked.gif)](../../fork).
